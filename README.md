A comprehensive research and data analysis of the highest-paid Data professional skills by country of origin. 
# Below are the steps I took to actualize my aim.
# Collection of data:
The data was collected from StackOverflow 
# Step two was to clean and preprocess data:
cleaning of data taken here to remove unwanted columns, errors, and duplicates using Power BI tools.
Use a delimiter to split the salary range column then find the average salary with Dax functions.
# Create a Visualization.
After the data was properly cleaned, The next process I took was to create a visualization with a variety of  visual tools such as :
1. A Treemap chart was used to display the list of countries available for the survey.
2. A clustered bar chart was used to display data skills  such as Data Science, Data engineer, Data Architecture, Data analyst, and database Admin.
3. A two-gauge was used to determine whether the workers were happy with their take-home salary and the standard of living.
4. A pie Chart was used to determine the difficulties between males and females who aspire to break into the Data field.
5. # Add a little interactivity by changing the themes and adding filters so as to make the visual easier to navigate
6. The last process was to save my own copy of the work in my storage drive and then upload it to Git Hub so that newcomers could use it for educational purposes.

# The Aim of this project was to determine which data skills receive the highest salary depending on the country of origin.
8. This project will not be completed without mentioning some of the difficulties such as data collection, cleaning, and picking the right visuals that are suitable for the job.
   Moreover, since Microsoft performs minor updates every two months, It's difficult to pick the proper visuals used for the project without reading the latest documentation
